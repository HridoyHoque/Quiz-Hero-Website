   <!-- Question Number 1- What is difference between map(), filter(), forEach(), find()?-->

   <p class="text-red-500">Q1: What is difference between map(), filter(), forEach(), find()?</p>
   <p>Answer: map(), filter(), forEach() and find() are JavaScript methods and we can manipulate arrays by using these methods. <br>
    map() transforms the values in an array and returns a new array, filter() selects elements based on a condition and returns a new array, forEach() calls a function for each element in the array but does not create a new array, and find() returns the first element that passes a condition or undefined.

 <!-- Question Number 2 What is the difference between local storage, session storage and cookies?-->

 <p class="mt-5 text-red-500">Q2: What is the difference between local storage, session storage and cookies?</p>
 <p>Answer: localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies all are storage mechanisms in web browsers but they have different characteristics and use cases.</p>
 
     1: LocalStorage and sessionStorage are mechanisms in web browsers and they are limited to storing data up to 5/10mb but on the other hand cookies are small text files stored on the user's computer.
     2: LocalStorage data can be accessible if event after the browser is closed but on the other hand sessionStorage data can not be accessible once after the browser is closed

   <!-- Question Number 3 -->

   <p class="mt-5 text-red-500">Q3: What is event bubble?</p>
   <p>Answer: The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that manages the asynchronous execution of code. It works by continuously checking the message queue for new messages, executing tasks or events, and waiting for new messages when the queue is empty. It's a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks without blocking the main thread.
